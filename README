Are you an RPG, board-game or Strategy Battle Game addict?
Do you hate when you're not at home and you suddenly have that "this-is-it!" idea for a new map in your party's everlasting adventure, but you don't know how to put it downâ€¦ and then something else fills your mind?
Don't worry anymore: this is the app you were waiting for.

* Select the size of your map, from 1x1 up to 20x20 tiles,
* Select tiles from internal sets (outdoor roads, city roads, outdoor fields),
* Use multitouch to zoom and pan your map
* Save it and share it with your friends!

Bonus features:
* Instead of selecting a tile, choose the random "?" tile to get a new and unexpected map!
* Maps do not need to be square, you can prepare a 5x2 dungeon or a 3x7 "Montecarlo circuit"!
* New sets will be added over time!
